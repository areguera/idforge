idforge is a framework to manage corporate identity manuals in
community. It gears the work of graphic designers, translators,
programmers and packagers using a modular design and standard
procedures that can be reused by different organizations.

idforge provides a publishing medium for organizations who want to
distribute normative information needed to reproduce their corporate
identity manual. Including the organization's brand, colors, visual
manifestations, and configuration files describing how these
components must be combined to achieve predictable results. For
graphic designers, it provides a tool to reproduce corporate identity
manuals consistently using customized artistic motif and the normative
specifications the organizations have provided.

idforge results useful for communities who need to distribute the
construction, maintenance and implementation of their own corporate
identity manuals. And this way, in community, reducing the work load
needed to renew it.
