msgid ""
"The <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis> command is the "
"unit testing framework used by <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge</emphasis> "
"developers to assure quality of idforge and its sub-commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis> command is "
"conceived to make easier for you to create and run automated quality "
"assurance tests for <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge</emphasis> and its sub-"
"commands quickly and consistently. Normally, you run <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis> several times a day, before committing "
"changes up to public repositories. So, to be sure your local changes didn’t "
"break anything. Likewise, when you fix a bug, to reproduce the expected "
"behaviour and refrain it from happening again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you execute the <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis> "
"command it looks for shell scripts inside the first level of the directories "
"you provided as argument in the command-line and executes them, one by one, "
"in the order they were found. Each shell script is considered to be a test "
"unit and is written to reproduce the specific features or behaviours you "

msgid "Integrity checks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The integrity checks provide the information needed to determine whether a "
"specific set of commands and, optionally, the output they produce are what "
"they are expected to be --based on the concerted opinion of both users and "
"developers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis>, the integrity "
"checks are triggered whenever the <emphasis role=\"strong\">command_line</"
"emphasis> function is called inside the shell script. This function "
"considers two methods of validation. One is through command’s exit status "
"and other based on the content of the files produced. From these methods, "
"the command’s exit status is always verified while the validations related "
"to files' content are performed at demand, when either <emphasis role="
"\"strong\">-m</emphasis> or <emphasis role=\"strong\">-e</emphasis> option "
"is provided in the command-line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command’s exit status"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The command’s exit status validates the execution of the command taken from "
"concatenating the command provided as argument to <emphasis role=\"strong\">-"
"c</emphasis> option and the arguments passed to <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">command_line</emphasis> function, inside the shell script. When the "
"command’s exit status is 0 it is considered to be a successful command, "
"otherwise it is a failed command. This check is useful to know that commands "
"were executed without errors (assuming those commands also agree that an "
"exit status of 0 is a successful command). However, this check doesn’t "
"validate the content produced by the executed command itself. To do so, it "
"is necessary to extend the integrity check by applying content-related "
"validation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Files' content validation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The files' content validation includes MIME validation and checksum "
"validation."
msgstr ""

msgid "MIME validation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method looks for a file with the <literal>.files</literal> extension in "
"the shell script auxiliary directory. When such a file is detected, "
"<emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis> makes a list of all "
"files inside the directory where final output is stored in for that shell "
"script and compares it with the one in the <literal>.files</literal> file, "
"so to determine whether they both are equal or not. If the result is equal, "
"it is a successful command, otherwise it is a failed command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method can be applied whenever you want to validate file formats and "
"one specific layout of files. However, this method doesn’t assure that all "
"files produced have the content they are expected to have."
msgstr ""

msgid "Checksum validation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method looks for files with the <literal>.md5sum</literal>, <literal>."
"sha1sum</literal> and <literal>.sha256sum</literal> extensions in the shell "
"script auxiliary directory. When either of such files are detected, "
"<emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis> makes a list of all "
"files inside the directory where final output is stored in for that shell "
"script and compares it with the one in the file holding the related list of "
"checksums. If everything matches, it is a successful command, otherwise it "
"is a failed command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Apply this check whenever you want to validate the files' content integrity "
"of one or more files bit-per-bit and also one specific layout of files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method, however, isn’t appropriate for content that change from one "
"rendering to another. For example, when you render HTML documents from "
"Asciidoc sources, the id value of HTML anchors is reset each time the HTML "
"document is rendered. This makes impossible to apply automated tests that "
"validate such files using an specific checksum since the file will have a "
"different digest each time the automated test is executed. In such cases, "
"the MIME validation is preferred."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exit Status"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exit status of <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-qatest(1)</emphasis> "
"command execution is the number of failed tests it found."
