msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The workplace created by <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-prepare(1)</"
"emphasis> is a regular directory in your workstation were you can rebuild "
"and change the visual identity of a particular organization. It contains the "
"configuration files and the artistic motif the <emphasis role=\"strong"

"manuals of that particular organization and the files necessary for "

"structure published by the organization you want to reproduce the visual "
"identity manual for and the files necessary for implementing it. The "
"artistic motif doesn’t exist in the workplace at that moment. Once you "
"create the workplace, you must create an artistic motif for it and put in "
"the correct place in order for the <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-render"
"(1)</emphasis> command to know about it. The final files are produced as "
"specified by the configuration files in the workplace."
msgstr ""

msgid "Artistic Motif"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The artistic motif controls the visual style (look and feel) of a particular "
"organization visual identity. There must be one unique artistic motif for "
"each workplace you create so the final files do hold a consistent look and "
"feel based on it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The artistic motif is a graphical pattern that is used as background on "
"different visual manifestations (images) to reinforce the visual connection "
"between them. In occasions, to accelerate the production of background "
"images in different sizes, the graphic designers create an artistic motif "
"made of several PNG images in high resolution and specific proportions, so "
"they can be resized or cropped later based on specific visual manifestation "
"needs using configuration files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration files describe how the components that make the "
"organization visual identity (e.g., image or document) are produced. They "
"establish the connection between source files, translation files, and also "
"the output location where final files will be stored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration files are used as reference to build the workplace "
"directory structure. When you execute <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-"
"prepare(1)</emphasis> it looks for all configuration file in a particular "
"organization identity package and creates a list with them. This list is "
"then used to build the workplace. For this reason, the first time you create "
"a workplace it only contains configuration files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The configuration files are produced by the organization that wants to "
"distribute its identity source files. You, as graphic designer, don’t need "
"to change them unless you want to change the final result a particular "
"organization expects about its visual identity."
msgstr ""

msgid "Identity Package"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The identity package is distributed by organizations using installable "
"formats (e.g., RPM or DEB). They install normative information about the "
"visual identity of one particular organization. By normative information "
"understand immutable source files (design models) necessary to rebuild the "
"organization’s visual identity structure using different visual styles. "
"Practically, this means that you can produce one image (visual "
"manifestation) using different background images (artistic motif) but "
"strictly based on the sizes and proportions the organization normalized in "
"the source files it distributed with the identity package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The source files in the identity package are used in configuration files "
"which in turn are used by <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge-render(1)</"
"emphasis> command to produce the final output based on them. Normally, the "
"identity packages provide source files in SVG format to produce images in "
"PNG format, AsciiDoc files to produce documents in PDF and HTML formats, and "
"translation files in PO format to localize both SVG and AsciiDoc files. When "
"you install an identity package the source files it provides are stored in a "
"read-only location (e.g., /usr/share/idforge/Models) where you shouldn’t "
"make changes to them. This is convenient when you want to reproduce the same "
"organization’s visual identity manual using different artistic motifs. "
"However, it isn’t so convenient when you want to change the visual identity "
"manual provided by a particular organization with the purpose of changing "
"the source files it provides to produce a brand new organization visual "
"identity manual."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To customize the source files in the identity package you need to join the "
"organization producing it and tell your interest in contribute to it. "
"Normally, you cannot not change the official identity package because the "
"organization producing it (hopefully) signs it digitally to grant a valid "
"distribution of it. Said this, if you want to make local changes based on "
"the source files provided by a particular identity package, you can to "
"identify what the source files you want to customize are and copy them to a "
"workplace so you can change them there. After that, you need to change the "
"configuration files in such workplace, so the files provided as value to "
"<emphasis role=\"strong\">render-from</emphasis> configuration options point "
"the source files in the workplace not the read-only location where you take "
"them from. When you do this, you may want to copy the related translation "
"files in PO format specified as value to <emphasis role=\"strong\">render-"
"from-po</emphasis> configuration options to your workplace, too; and change "
"the related configuration files to point to them, as well."
