# design models make use of external files which point to specific
# artistic motif background images. If such external files don't
# exist, try to create the background image required by cropping a
# higher background image immediately available.  If this isn't
# possible either (e.g., no background images is available), then
# create the background image using a plain color as last option.  We
# can't go on without the required background information.
