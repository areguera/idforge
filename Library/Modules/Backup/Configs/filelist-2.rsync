# Filtering rules set in this file are designed to backup files in an
# environment where there are two 250GB identical hard drives
# configured to do software RAID-1 and one external USB device of
# 150GB available to make important backups from RAID-1. The RAID-1
# contains the CentOS distribution (default partitioning) and is
# considered the primary source of information, here is where most
# work is done.  The external USB device is used to backup critical
# information only (e.g., development projects).

# Auto-ignore files in the same way CVS does (e.g., ignore .svn/
# directories).
#-C

# Backup home directories. Because the external drive has less space
# than the hard drive, only backup my projects.
