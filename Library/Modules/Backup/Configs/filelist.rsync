# Filtering rules set in this file are designed to backup files in an
# environment where two identical hardrives are available. The first
# hard drive contains the CentOS distribution (default partitioning)
# and is concidered the primary source of information, here is where
# most work is done. The second hard drive is just one partition
# (writable by root only) dedicated to save information from first
# hard drive.

# Auto-ignore files in the same way CVS does (e.g., ignore .svn/
# directories).
