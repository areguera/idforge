#
#   This configuration file builds illustrative image describing
#   idFORGE Framework and installation media for it in different
#   format and locales. The final images produced from this
#   configuration file example are stored in the Images/Final
#   directory and can be used to communicate how idFORGE identity
#   (e.g., brand, release number, type of media, architecture, media
#   relation must be set on the visible area of a CD or DVD) must be
#   applied on installation media.
#
#       NOTE: The whole point here is taking effective control over
#       the visual identity communication of an specific project or
#       organization, so it can be better recognized.  Normally, this
#       sort of communication goes through the project's own idea
#       about what its identity is.
#
#   This configuration file also shows you how it is possible to
#   customize the visual style of several images by changing just a
#   single background image (the artistic motif). This is idFORGE
#   Framework's one of the most important features because with it you
#   can maintain different visual styles for the same visual
#   manifestation.
#
#   This configuration file is a good example to describe the standard
#   procedures implemented inside idforge-render(1) and
#   idforge-locale(1) that help coordinate production of localized
#   consistently.
#
#   To test construction of final images you need to: 
#
#   1. Create a workplace from idFORGE identity model (the default)
#   using a command like the following:
#
#       ]$ idforge prepare ~/Desktop/idforge-workplace
#
#       NOTE: You can enter whatever location you want here.  See
#       idforge-prepare(1) for more information about workplaces.
#
#   2. Get in the workplace you just created:
#
#       ]$ cd ~/Desktop/idforge-workplace
#
#   3. Run the following command: 
#
#       ]$ idforge render Images/idforge.conf
#
#       NOTE: To test construction of localized final images you need
#       to add the LANG environment variable in the command-line, just
#       before the idforge command.
#       
#       For example:
#
#       ]$ LANG=es_ES.UTF-8 idforge render Images/idforge.conf
#
#   The configuration file is organized in sections so it can be
#   easier to understand the concept of image dependencies described
#   in idforge-render(1) documentation manual. This concept is crucial
#   to optimize the image production process. For example, this
#   configuration file begins creating the branding information which
#   is common to all images, then it goes to more specific images like
#   backgrounds, and image compositions to gather all the pieces
#   needed to build final images.
#
#   If you have any question regarding this configuration file or
#   idforge(1) commands, please write to CentOS Artwork SIG
#   <centos-devel@centos.org>.
