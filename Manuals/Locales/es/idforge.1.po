msgid ""
"The <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge(1)</emphasis> command is written in "
"Bash using a modular design specially conceived to gear the work of graphic "
"designers, translators and documentation writers in a way they can "
"collaborate consistently one another in a decentralized environment ruled by "
"the normative specifications of a particular community or organization that "
"is very interested in making its visual identity manual and the files "
"necessary for its implementation a community effort."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge(1)</emphasis> command may result "
"useful for any kind of organization, specially those needing to:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consolidate an effective and efficient community enrolment in the process of "
"building the organization’s own visual identity and its further "
"implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consolidate an effective and efficient procedure to propagate new visual "
"styles (a.k.a., artistic motifs) to all visual manifestations the "
"organization shows its existence on. This, grants the visual consistency "
"which is necessary to implement a monolithic corporate visual identity "
"structure correctly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The organization interested in using the <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge(1)"
"</emphasis> command to manage its visual identity publishes an easy to "
"install package that contains all the source files necessary to build its "
"brand, its visual identity manual and the related implementation files. The "
"information this package provides is normative and is installed in the "
"\"<literal>/usr/share/idforge-${PROJECTNAME}/</literal>\" directory. This "
"directory provides a read-only location where regular users cannot write and "
"the <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge(1)</emphasis> command can predict "
"where to retrieve organization-specific visual identity source files. The "
"name of the package also follows the \"<literal>idforge-${PROJECTNAME}</"
"literal>\" naming convention in order to keep them predictable and make "
"their installation easier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <emphasis role=\"strong\">idforge(1)</emphasis> command cannot produce "
"content directly inside the read-only directory where the normative "
"information was installed in. Instead, it uses the <emphasis role=\"strong"
"\">idforge-prepare(1)</emphasis> command to create a writeable instance of "
"it so you can study and change the source files used to build the "
"organization’s visual identity in your own workstation without affecting the "
"official version of it. You can use the files in the instance as template to "
"create a brand new visual identity package or contribute improvements to the "
"visual identity of the organization who published the normative information "
"in first place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most organizations have restrictions about the way their brands are used. If "
"you are creating a brand new corporate visual identity manual based on "
"another organization’s, be sure to make the appropriate changes in the one "
"you are creating in order to be consequent with the branding restriction "
"that organization specified."

"initialization script and it is considered a common option. When the option "
"argument is written after the command argument, it is interpreted by the "
"related command and it is considered a specific options to that command "
"instead."
