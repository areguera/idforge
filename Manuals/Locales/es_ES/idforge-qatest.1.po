"The <placeholder-1/> command is the unit testing framework used by "
"<placeholder-2/> developers to assure quality of idforge and its "
"sub-commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <placeholder-1/> command is conceived to make easier for you to "
"create and run automated quality assurance tests for <placeholder-2/"
"> and its sub-commands quickly and consistently. Normally, you run "
"<placeholder-3/> several times a day, before committing changes up "
"to public repositories. So, to be sure your local changes didn’t "
"break anything. Likewise, when you fix a bug, to reproduce the "
"expected behaviour and refrain it from happening again."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you execute the <placeholder-1/> command it looks for shell "
"scripts inside the first level of the directories you provided as "
"argument in the command-line and executes them, one by one, in the "
"order they were found. Each shell script is considered to be a test "
"unit and is written to reproduce the specific features or "
"behaviours you want to validate using integrity checks."

"Creates the shell script you need to implement a new assurance "
"test. When you provide this option you are prompted to enter the "

msgid "Integrity checks"

msgid ""
"The integrity checks provide the information needed to determine "
"whether a specific set of commands and, optionally, the output they "

"opinion of both users and developers."
msgstr ""

msgid "command_line"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In <placeholder-1/>, the integrity checks are triggered whenever "
"the <placeholder-2/> function is called inside the shell script. "
"This function considers two methods of validation. One is through "
"command’s exit status and other based on the content of the files "
"produced. From these methods, the command’s exit status is always "
"verified while the validations related to files' content are "
"performed at demand, when either <placeholder-3/> or <placeholder-4/"
"> option is provided in the command-line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command’s exit status"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The command’s exit status validates the execution of the command "
"taken from concatenating the command provided as argument to "
"<placeholder-1/> option and the arguments passed to <placeholder-2/"
"> function, inside the shell script. When the command’s exit status "
"is 0 it is considered to be a successful command, otherwise it is a "
"failed command. This check is useful to know that commands were "
"executed without errors (assuming those commands also agree that an "
"exit status of 0 is a successful command). However, this check "
"doesn’t validate the content produced by the executed command "
"itself. To do so, it is necessary to extend the integrity check by "
"applying content-related validation."

"validation."

msgid ""
"This method looks for a file with the <placeholder-1/> extension in "
"the shell script auxiliary directory. When such a file is detected, "
"<placeholder-2/> makes a list of all files inside the directory "
"where final output is stored in for that shell script and compares "
"it with the one in the <placeholder-3/> file, so to determine "
"whether they both are equal or not. If the result is equal, it is a "
"successful command, otherwise it is a failed command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method can be applied whenever you want to validate file "
"formats and one specific layout of files. However, this method "

"directory. When either of such files are detected, <placeholder-4/> "
"makes a list of all files inside the directory where final output "
"is stored in for that shell script and compares it with the one in "
"the file holding the related list of checksums. If everything "
"matches, it is a successful command, otherwise it is a failed "
"command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Apply this check whenever you want to validate the files' content "
"integrity of one or more files bit-per-bit and also one specific "
"layout of files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method, however, isn’t appropriate for content that change "
"from one rendering to another. For example, when you render HTML "
"documents from Asciidoc sources, the id value of HTML anchors is "
"reset each time the HTML document is rendered. This makes "
"impossible to apply automated tests that validate such files using "
"an specific checksum since the file will have a different digest "
"each time the automated test is executed. In such cases, the MIME "
"validation is preferred."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exit Status"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exit status of <placeholder-1/> command execution is the number "
