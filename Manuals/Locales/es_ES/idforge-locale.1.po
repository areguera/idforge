"The <placeholder-1/> command allows you to manage the creation, "
"actualization, edition and elimination of translation files in PO "
"and MO formats for a wide range of programming languages including "
"shell scripts and XML-based file formats like SVG, HTML and "
"DocBook. This command stands on the procedures implemented by both "
"<placeholder-2/> and <placeholder-3/> commands and is specially "
"designed to reuse the configuration files the <placeholder-4/> "
"command employs to render content. So, it results very useful when "
"you need a standard procedure to maintain localized images, "
"documents, and shell scripts in a community environment."

"The <placeholder-1/> command reads the configuration files provided "
"as argument in the command-line in the same order they were "
"provided, one by one. Inside each configuration file, the sections "
"are processed in the same order they were found, from top to "
"bottom, using the extension of the first source file provided to "
"<placeholder-2/> option as reference to initiate the localization "
"process. When configuration sections are being processed, "
"<placeholder-3/> evaluates the number of times both <placeholder-4/"
"> and <placeholder-5/> options have been provided in it. From this "
"analysis the following two relations between files can be "
"established for further processing:"

"second translation file holds translatable strings for the second "
"source file, and so on for each source and translation file "
