"The <placeholder-1/> command is written in Bash using a modular design "
"specially conceived to gear the work of graphic designers, translators and "
"documentation writers in a way they can collaborate consistently one another "
"in a decentralized environment ruled by the normative specifications of a "
"particular community or organization that is very interested in making its "
"visual identity manual and the files necessary for its implementation a "
"community effort."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The <placeholder-1/> command may result useful for any kind of organization, "
"specially those needing to:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consolidate an effective and efficient community enrolment in the process of "
"building the organization’s own visual identity and its further "
"implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consolidate an effective and efficient procedure to propagate new visual "
"styles (a.k.a., artistic motifs) to all visual manifestations the "
"organization shows its existence on. This, grants the visual consistency "
"which is necessary to implement a monolithic corporate visual identity "
"structure correctly."

"The organization interested in using the <placeholder-1/> command to manage "
"its visual identity publishes an easy to install package that contains all "
"the source files necessary to build its brand, its visual identity manual "
"and the related implementation files. The information this package provides "
"is normative and is installed in the \"<placeholder-2/>\" directory. This "
"directory provides a read-only location where regular users cannot write and "
"the <placeholder-3/> command can predict where to retrieve organization-"
"specific visual identity source files. The name of the package also follows "
"the \"<placeholder-4/>\" naming convention in order to keep them predictable "
"and make their installation easier."

msgid ""
"The <placeholder-1/> command cannot produce content directly inside the read-"
"only directory where the normative information was installed in. Instead, it "
"uses the <placeholder-2/> command to create a writeable instance of it so "
"you can study and change the source files used to build the organization’s "
"visual identity in your own workstation without affecting the official "
"version of it. You can use the files in the instance as template to create a "
"brand new visual identity package or contribute improvements to the visual "
"identity of the organization who published the normative information in "
"first place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most organizations have restrictions about the way their brands are used. If "
"you are creating a brand new corporate visual identity manual based on "
"another organization’s, be sure to make the appropriate changes in the one "
"you are creating in order to be consequent with the branding restriction "
"that organization specified."

"<placeholder-2/> initialization script and it is considered a common option. "
"When the option argument is written after the command argument, it is "
"interpreted by the related command and it is considered a specific options "
"to that command instead."
