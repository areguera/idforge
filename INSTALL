This document describes the installation of idFORGE Framework. 

Overview
--------

The idFORGE Framework doesn't have a Yum repository, yet. Such
infrastructure is desired and will be addressed in the future (I
hope). By now, the packages and related signatures can be downloaded
and installed from the following location:

    http://wiki.centos.org/ArtWork/Framework

Once you've downloaded the RPM package, run the following command as
root user:

    rpm -Uvhf idforge-*.rpm

    CAUTION: This action will replace the old tcar package and all its
    sub-packages. The last release of the tcar package was 0.12.

Packages
--------

The idFORGE Framework is distributed in a single signed package with
the following naming convention:

    idforge-x.y-z.%{_dist}.noarch.rpm

    Install path: `/usr/share/idforge'

You can extend idFORGE Framework functionality by installing identity
packages distributed by particular organizations.  Such packages
provide source files about the visual identity of the organization
that distributes them (e.g., brand, brushes, fonts, palette of colors,
configuration files and a detailed description about all visual
manifestations the organization wants to express its existence on).
The identity packages have the following naming convention:

    idforge-${PROJECT_NAME}-x.y-z.%{_dist}.noarch.rpm

    Install path: `/usr/share/idforge/Models/${PROJECT_NAME}'

    NOTE: Fonts are released as individual packages (e.g.,
    denmark-sans-fonts, vegur-sans-fonts, vegur-serif-fonts,
    vegur-sans-mono-fonts, etc.) and installed under
    `/usr/share/fonts' directory.

More information about particular packages can be found in the SPEC
file used to build it.
