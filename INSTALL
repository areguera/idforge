This document describes the installation of iforge framework.  You can
read this document to get a global idea about idforge packages and
decide which of them you need to install.

Overview
--------

idforge was conceived to be installed and run in CentOS 6. All
packages required by idforge are available from the base repository of
CentOS 6 so you don't need to install third party repositories to get
into production with idforge framework.

At this time there is not a Yum repository available for idforge
framework. Such infrastructure is desired and will be addressed in the
future. By now, packages related to idforge framework can be
downloaded and installed from the following location:

    http://wiki.centos.org/ArtWork/Framework

These packages are all signed. So you need to import the related GPG
key to your system's RPM database first in order to install these
packages correctly. The GPG key you need to import is also available
in the address shown above.

To install these packages, run the following command as root user in
the location where you downloaded them:

    rpm -Uvhf idforge*.rpm

Packages
--------

The packages related to idforge framework are all written in lowercase
and comply the following naming convention:

    idforge-${CATEGORY}-${NAME}.%{_dist}.noarch.rpm

Where CATEGORY can take one of the following values:

    modules
        Provides modules used to extend idforge library. In this case,
        NAME is always a verb describing the action of the command it
        represents (e.g., prepare, render, locale, tuneup, etc.).
        Packages in this category are installed in the
        /usr/libexec/idforge-modules-${NAME} directory (e.g., the
        initialization script of hello module is installed at
        /usr/libexec/idforge-modules-Hello/hello.sh). Note that module
        directory is written with the first letter in uppercase while
        its initialization script is written in lowercase.

    models
        Provides normative information describing the corporate
        identity (design models) of different organizations. In this
        case, NAME is always the name of the organization which
        normative information is created for (e.g., centos, gnu,
        fedora, etc.). Packages in this category are installed in the
        /usr/share/idforge-models-${NAME} directory (e.g., CentOS
        design models are installed at
        /usr/share/idforge-models-centos directory).

Here is the list of available packages you need to download:

idforge
    This package provides the `idforge' command-line interface and
    related information, including the library of shared functions,
    documentation and localization files.  
    
        NOTE: This package doesn't provide any module. Modules for
              idforge are provided in their own packages and you need
              to install them yourself in order to execute them.

    Install path: `/usr/libexec/idforge'

idforge-modules
    This package doesn't provide any file. However you can install it
    if you want to install all modules available by running a single
    command.
    
    Install path: none

idforge-modules-hello
    This package provides the `hello' module. This module prints a
    greeting and exits successfully.  It provides examples about using
    the different module supported and conventions about coding style
    used as reference to write modules.
    
    Install path: `/usr/libexec/idforge-modules-hello'

idforge-modules-prepare

    the working directory where you produce corporate identity
    manuals. It sets the directory structure needed plus all
    configuration files needed to initiate the rendition process.

idforge-modules-locale
    This package provides the `locale' module. This module retrieves
    translatable strings from translatable design models and stores
    them in PO files for translators to edit. The result produced by
    this module is also used by the `render' module to produce
    localized content. 

    Install path: `/usr/libexec/idforge-modules-locale'

idforge-modules-tuneup
    This package provides the `tuneup' module. This module optimizes
    design models' source files whenever it is possible (e.g., remove
    unused objects from SVG files, transforms HTML documents into
    XHTML documents).

    Install path: `/usr/libexec/idforge-modules-tuneup'

    (e.g., stationery, clothes) and documentation describing how each
    organization should distribute their design models for graphic
    designers to rebuild them using their own artistic motifs. 
    
    Install path: `/usr/share/idforge-models-default'

        NOTE: Fonts are released as individual packages without the _
              idforge_ name on them  (e.g., denmark-sans-fonts,
              vegur-sans-fonts, vegur-serif-fonts,
              vegur-sans-mono-fonts, etc.) and installed under
