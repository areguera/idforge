This document describes the installation of idFORGE Framework. 

Overview
--------

The idFORGE Framework is conceived to be installed in a CentOS 6
GNU/Linux distribution which provides all the software necessary to
get right into production. There is no need to install third party
repositories.

The idFORGE Framework doesn't have Yum repository by now. Such
infrastructure is desired and will be addressed in the future (I
hope). By now, the packages can be downloaded and installed from the
following location:

    http://wiki.centos.org/ArtWork/Framework

The idFORGE Framework packages packages are all signed. So you need to
import the related GPG key to your system's RPM database first in
order to install these packages correctly. The GPG key you need to
import is also available in the address shown above.

To install these packages, run the following command as root user in
the location where you downloaded them:

    rpm -Uvhf idforge*.rpm

    CAUTION: This action will replaces the old tcar package. The last
    release of the tcar package was 0.12.

Packages
--------

The idFORGE Framework is distributed in a single package with the
following naming convention:

    idforge-x.y.%{_dist}.noarch.rpm

    Install path: `/usr/share/idforge'

The idFORGE Framework works with identity packages distributed by
organizations.  These packages provide normative files about a
particular organization (e.g., brand, brushes, fonts, palette of
colors, configuration files and a detailed description about all
visual manifestations the organization wants to express its existence
on). The identity packages have the following naming convention:

    idforge-${MODEL}-x.y.%{_dist}.noarch.rpm

    Install path: `/usr/share/idforge/Models/${MODEL}'

    NOTE: Fonts are released as individual packages (e.g.,
    denmark-sans-fonts, vegur-sans-fonts, vegur-serif-fonts,
    vegur-sans-mono-fonts, etc.) and installed under
    `/usr/share/fonts' directory.

More information about particular packages can be found in the SPEC
file used to build it.
