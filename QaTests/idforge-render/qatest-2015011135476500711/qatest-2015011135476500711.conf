#   Set explicit values to all supported options (except
#   render-from-po) so they can be tested. In this case, the
#   manpage.1.asciidoc file is transformed to manpage, xhtml and pdf
#   formats using a manpage document structure. The result is produced
#   in the same language it was initially written in the
#   manpage.1.asciidoc file.
#
#   Expected directory structure:
